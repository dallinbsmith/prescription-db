# Competitor Analysis — Telehealth & Online Pharmacy Landscape

> **Research Date:** 2026-02-17
> **Purpose:** Internal pharmacy research for understanding online/telehealth prescription models

---

## Executive Summary

Modern telehealth pharmacies work around traditional prescription requirements through three primary mechanisms:

1. **Asynchronous Telehealth Consultations** — Licensed providers review questionnaires and prescribe without in-person visits
2. **Compounding Pharmacy Networks** — 503A/503B facilities create "personalized" formulations that technically differ from FDA-approved products
3. **Cash-Pay Models** — Bypassing insurance avoids PBM oversight and allows direct pricing

## Detailed Competitor Analysis

### 1. Hims & Hers (forhims.com / forhers.com)

**Business Model:** Subscription-based telehealth with compounding pharmacy fulfillment

**Key Drug Categories:**
- Erectile Dysfunction: Sildenafil, Tadalafil
- Hair Loss: Finasteride, Minoxidil
- Weight Loss: Compounded Semaglutide, Tirzepatide
- Mental Health: SSRIs (escitalopram, fluoxetine) — NO controlled substances
- Women's Health: Birth control, Tretinoin

**How They "Work Around" Prescriptions:**
- Asynchronous provider review (questionnaire-based, no video required in most states)
- Partner compounding pharmacies create "personalized" formulations
- Cash-pay model ($22-199/month depending on medication)

**Regulatory Status (2026):**
- Under DOJ investigation for compounded GLP-1 marketing
- Novo Nordisk lawsuit filed February 2026 for patent infringement

### 2. Ro (ro.co)

**Business Model:** Telehealth with 12 in-house pharmacies + brand partnerships

**Key Drug Categories:**
- Erectile Dysfunction: Sildenafil, Tadalafil, Viagra, Cialis
- Hair Loss: Finasteride, Minoxidil (oral/topical)

- Premature Ejaculation: Roman Swipes (benzocaine)

**How They "Work Around" Prescriptions:**
- Asynchronous telehealth consultations
- MSO/Friendly PC model to avoid corporate practice of medicine rules
- Direct manufacturer partnerships (Novo Nordisk) for brand-name GLP-1s

**Key Differentiator:** Pivoted to brand-name GLP-1 partnerships rather than compounding, reducing regulatory risk

**Pricing:**

|-----------|-------|
| Membership | $145/month |
| Wegovy Pill | $149-299/month |
| Wegovy Pen (via NovoCare) | $499/month |

### 3. Cost Plus Drugs (costplusdrugs.com)

**Business Model:** Transparent pricing pharmacy — NOT telehealth (requires external prescription)

**Formula:** `Drug Cost + 15% Markup + $5 Pharmacy Fee + $5.25 Shipping`

**Key Features:**
- 2,200+ medications (mostly generics)
- No PBM involvement
- In-house manufacturing facility in Dallas for shortage drugs
- Expanding into biosimilars (YUSIMRY at 85% off)

**How It's Different:**
- Requires prescription from patient's own doctor
- No telehealth consultations
- Purely a pharmacy, not a prescribing service
- Transparent pricing eliminates PBM spread

**Example Savings:**
- Imatinib (Gleevec generic): $47/month vs. $9,657 retail
- YUSIMRY (Humira biosimilar): $526.75 vs. $3,500

### 4. GoodRx (goodrx.com)

**Business Model:** Prescription discount platform (NOT a pharmacy)

**How It Works:**
1. Consumer searches drug on GoodRx
2. GoodRx shows discounted prices at nearby pharmacies
3. Consumer presents coupon at pharmacy
4. PBM processes transaction
5. GoodRx earns commission

**Revenue Model:**
- Prescription transaction fees (commission from PBMs)
- Pharma manufacturer advertising
- GoodRx Gold subscription ($5.99/month)

**Regulatory Issues:**
- FTC $1.5M penalty (2023) for sharing health data with Facebook/Google
- NOT covered by HIPAA
- Some allegations of "algorithmic price-fixing" through PBM integration

---

### 5. Maximus Tribe (maximustribe.com)

**Business Model:** Men's health telehealth with at-home testing

**Key Products:**
- **Enclomiphene** (flagship) — NOT FDA-approved but legally compoundable
- Testosterone Cypionate (Schedule III controlled)
- Compounded Semaglutide
- Sermorelin (peptide)

**How They "Work Around" Prescriptions:**
- At-home blood testing → results reviewed by provider → prescription issued
- Enclomiphene is compoundable because it's derived from FDA-approved Clomid
- No video consultation required

**Pricing:** $129/month for testosterone optimization

**Regulatory Risk:** Enclomiphene exists in legal gray area; testosterone is Schedule III

---

### 6. Fridays (joinfridays.com)

**Business Model:** GLP-1 weight loss telehealth

**Products:**
- Compounded Semaglutide (injectable, sublingual, oral)
- Compounded Tirzepatide
- Semaglutide + B12 + L-Carnitine combinations

**How They "Work Around" Post-Shortage Restrictions:**
- Adding B12/L-carnitine creates "personalized" formulation
- Sublingual/oral delivery differs from FDA-approved injectables
- Explicit disclaimers: "not FDA-approved"
- Uses third-party clinical services (OpenLoop Health)

**Pricing:** $199-249/month

**Legal Status:** Operating in contested territory; Eli Lilly states this "is breaking the law"

---

### 7. SkinnyRx (skinnyrx.com)

**Business Model:** GLP-1 weight loss telehealth

**Products:**
- Injectable Semaglutide
- Sublingual Semaglutide
- Oral Semaglutide Tablets
- Tirzepatide Tablets

**Differentiation:** Multiple delivery forms (sublingual, oral tablet) that differ from FDA-approved injectable-only products

**Pricing:** $199-299/month

---

## Legal Frameworks Enabling These Models

### Section 503A (Traditional Compounding)
- Allows pharmacies to compound patient-specific medications
- Requires valid prescription from licensed provider
- Cannot be "essentially copies" of FDA-approved drugs
- **Workaround:** Add ingredients or change delivery form

### Section 503B (Outsourcing Facilities)
- Bulk compounding under FDA registration
- Must follow cGMP standards
- Allowed for drugs in shortage

### Telehealth Prescribing
- State medical boards regulate requirements
- Most states allow asynchronous consultations for non-controlled substances
- Ryan Haight Act restricts controlled substance telehealth prescribing

### Corporate Practice of Medicine (CPOM)
- Most states prohibit corporations from practicing medicine
- **Workaround:** Management Services Organization (MSO) model
- Technology company handles admin; physician practice makes clinical decisions

---

## Key Regulatory Risks (2026)

1. **GLP-1 Compounding Crackdown**
   - FDA declared shortages resolved (semaglutide Feb 2025, tirzepatide Oct 2024)
   - Grace periods expired May 2025
   - Manufacturers actively suing compounders
   - Courts ruling in favor of FDA/manufacturers

2. **State Telehealth Variations**
   - Some states require video visits
   - Controlled substance restrictions vary
   - Provider licensing requirements

3. **FTC/Privacy Enforcement**
   - Telehealth companies subject to FTC oversight
   - Health Breach Notification Rule applies
   - GoodRx settlement sets precedent

---

## Strategic Implications

### What's Working
1. **Asynchronous telehealth** dramatically reduces friction
2. **Cash-pay models** bypass PBM complexity
3. **Compounding** creates legal (if contested) pathway to generic alternatives
4. **Direct-to-consumer** shipping eliminates pharmacy visits
5. **Subscription models** drive recurring revenue

### Regulatory Arbitrage Opportunities
- Medications not in FDA shortage but still compoundable
- "Personalized" formulations with added ingredients
- Alternative delivery forms (sublingual, oral vs. injectable)
- Non-controlled substance alternatives (e.g., enclomiphene vs. testosterone)

### Warning Signs
- Manufacturers increasingly litigious (Novo Nordisk, Eli Lilly)
- FDA enforcement increasing
- DOJ investigations (Hims)
- Quality control issues with compounded medications
